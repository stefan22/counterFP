# counter

- basic vanilla javascript counter app....

- using hyperscript js library to render DOM elements/views

- a virtual DOM library - added performance (in order to replace/update only those parts  
  that need be updated within DOM)

- (only impure function)
  > app function - (a mixed of HOF/Closure and state changes bskt..)
